# Pokémon Image Puzzle Generator
This Python script leverages the Pillow library for image processing to create composite images or puzzles using individual images of Pokémon characters, specifically Wartortle. The script provides functionality for combining and arranging these images in various ways.

Key Features:
Opening and Saving Images:

Utilizes the Image.open() method to open individual images of Pokémon characters, with a focus on Wartortle.
Incorporates the img.save(file) function to save the opened image, allowing for future reference or modification.
Combining Images Side by Side:

Implements sections of code to combine Pokémon images side by side, creating larger composite images.
Utilizes the Image.new() method to generate a new blank image with the combined width and pastes individual Pokémon images onto it.
Image Averaging (Incomplete):

Includes a section attempting to calculate the average of a set of images. Note that this part of the code seems incomplete and might require further refinement for a specific use case.
Displaying Images:

Employs img.show() to display the images, providing a quick visual representation of the combined or processed images using the default system image viewer.
Example Use Case:
Combine images of Pokémon characters to create a puzzle or mosaic effect.
Experiment with different arrangements to generate visually interesting compositions.
Usage:
Ensure that the Pillow library is installed (pip install Pillow).
Modify file paths and filenames according to your directory structure and image files.
Run the script to generate combined Pokémon images.
Feel free to explore and customize the script for your creative projects involving Pokémon image manipulation.
